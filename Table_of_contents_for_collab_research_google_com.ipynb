    "This is no different, it is the nature of the problem. Learning programming is exactly like playing music, the good and the bad.\n",
    "As you start to learn music/code, your music/code will not work at first, then it will sound/run terrible, but you must practice and learn to \"fail upwards\" by learning what not to do by doing it yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually you become a maestro, and will be able to improv code that makes the non-programmers stare in amazement. Fair warning, music might help you make more friends, but programming will make computers do your work for you so you have more time for the finer aspects of life.\n",
    "\n",
    "I cannot hope to teach you everything about programming in two-days, so I hope to show you a quick overview, teach you very carefully the hardest part of python (the reference/side-affects/spooky action at a distance). Finally, we'll talk about examples, as you'll probably eventually learn programming from googling your problem and reading other peoples code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything in here is code, you can edit these pages, change them, rerun the code. You must do this, break it, then learn how to put it together again.\n",
